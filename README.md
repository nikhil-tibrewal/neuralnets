Neural Network Implementation in Python
==========

An implementation of neural network with 1 hidden layer in python. I adapted it from the neural network code I wrote for an assignment for the Coursera Machine Learning course. I've tested it on the dataset provided in the Coursera assignment, and on the iris data set from http://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/. The dimensions in comments helped me do matrix operations easily. They are dimensions of the coursera dataset (5000 x 400 with a hidden layer of 25 units).

Feel free to take a look at it for reference or suggest improvements to it.
